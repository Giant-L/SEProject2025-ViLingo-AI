1
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.003
Good morning. How are you?

2
00:00:04.602 --> 00:00:07.602
(Audience) Good.

3
00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.258
It's been great, hasn't it?

4
00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.603
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

5
00:00:10.653 --> 00:00:13.653
In fact, I'm leaving.

6
00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.169
(Laughter)

7
00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:21.537
There have been three themesrunning through the conference,

8
00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.847
which are relevantto what I want to talk about.

9
00:00:23.897 --> 00:00:28.341
One is the extraordinaryevidence of human creativity

10
00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:30.778
in all of the presentations that we've had

11
00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:32.754
and in all of the people here;

12
00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:36.008
just the variety of itand the range of it.

13
00:00:36.058 --> 00:00:38.175
The second is that it's put us in a place

14
00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:40.696
where we have no ideawhat's going to happen

15
00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:42.111
in terms of the future.

16
00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:45.161
No idea how this may play out.

17
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.766
I have an interest in education.

18
00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:51.202
Actually, what I find is,everybody has an interest in education.

19
00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:52.543
Don't you?

20
00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:53.969
I find this very interesting.

21
00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.951
If you're at a dinner party,and you say you work in education --

22
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.001
actually, you're not oftenat dinner parties, frankly.

23
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
(Laughter)

24
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.590
If you work in education,you're not asked.

25
00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:10.042
(Laughter)

26
00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:14.178
And you're never asked back, curiously.That's strange to me.

27
00:01:14.228 --> 00:01:16.418
But if you are, and you say to somebody,

28
00:01:16.468 --> 00:01:18.220
you know, they say, "What do you do?"

29
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.932
and you say you work in education,

30
00:01:19.982 --> 00:01:22.005
you can see the blood run from their face.

31
00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:25.055
They're like, "Oh my God. Why me?"

32
00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:26.764
(Laughter)

33
00:01:26.064 --> 00:01:29.064
"My one night out all week."

34
00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:30.612
(Laughter)

35
00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:33.461
But if you ask about their education,they pin you to the wall,

36
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.892
because it's one of those thingsthat goes deep with people, am I right?

37
00:01:36.942 --> 00:01:40.409
Like religion and money and other things.

38
00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.875
So I have a big interest in education,and I think we all do.

39
00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:46.701
We have a huge vested interest in it,

40
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.045
partly because it's educationthat's meant to take us into this future

41
00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:51.723
that we can't grasp.

42
00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:52.913
If you think of it,

43
00:01:52.963 --> 00:02:00.122
children starting school this yearwill be retiring in 2065.

44
00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:01.717
Nobody has a clue,

45
00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:05.300
despite all the expertise that's beenon parade for the past four days,

46
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.850
what the world will look likein five years' time.

47
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.168
And yet, we're meantto be educating them for it.

48
00:02:10.218 --> 00:02:13.218
So the unpredictability,I think, is extraordinary.

49
00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:16.194
And the third part of thisis that we've all agreed, nonetheless,

50
00:02:16.244 --> 00:02:21.523
on the really extraordinarycapacities that children have --

51
00:02:21.573 --> 00:02:23.882
their capacities for innovation.

52
00:02:23.932 --> 00:02:26.695
I mean, Sirena last nightwas a marvel, wasn't she?

53
00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:28.389
Just seeing what she could do.

54
00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.962
And she's exceptional, but I thinkshe's not, so to speak,

55
00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:36.891
exceptional in the whole of childhood.

56
00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:39.746
What you have there is a personof extraordinary dedication

57
00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:40.941
who found a talent.

58
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:43.551
And my contention is,all kids have tremendous talents,

59
00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:46.601
and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.

60
00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.850
So I want to talk about education,

61
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.746
and I want to talk about creativity.

62
00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:55.866
My contention is that creativity nowis as important in education as literacy,

63
00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:58.916
and we should treat itwith the same status.

64
00:02:58.727 --> 00:03:01.727
(Applause)

65
00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:02.863
Thank you.

66
00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:04.076
(Applause)

67
00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:08.385
That was it, by the way.Thank you very much.

68
00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:10.695
(Laughter)

69
00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:12.834
So, 15 minutes left.

70
00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:14.535
(Laughter)

71
00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:17.716
"Well, I was born ... "

72
00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:19.411
(Laughter)

73
00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:22.530
I heard a great story recently --I love telling it --

74
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.925
of a little girlwho was in a drawing lesson.

75
00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:27.124
She was six, and she wasat the back, drawing,

76
00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:29.908
and the teacher said this girlhardly ever paid attention,

77
00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.718
and in this drawing lesson, she did.

78
00:03:31.768 --> 00:03:33.082
The teacher was fascinated.

79
00:03:33.132 --> 00:03:35.895
She went over to her,and she said, "What are you drawing?"

80
00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:39.492
And the girl said,"I'm drawing a picture of God."

81
00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:42.834
And the teacher said, "But nobodyknows what God looks like."

82
00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:45.884
And the girl said,"They will in a minute."

83
00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:47.996
(Laughter)

84
00:03:56.562 --> 00:03:59.263
When my son was four in England --

85
00:03:59.313 --> 00:04:02.313
actually, he was foureverywhere, to be honest.

86
00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:04.528
(Laughter)

87
00:04:03.304 --> 00:04:06.665
If we're being strict about it,wherever he went, he was four that year.

88
00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:09.715
He was in the Nativity play.Do you remember the story?

89
00:04:09.377 --> 00:04:12.377
(Laughter)

90
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.421
No, it was big, it was a big story.

91
00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:15.471
Mel Gibson did the sequel,you may have seen it.

92
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.800
(Laughter)

93
00:04:16.085 --> 00:04:17.620
"Nativity II."

94
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.528
But James got the part of Joseph,which we were thrilled about.

95
00:04:21.578 --> 00:04:24.458
We considered this to beone of the lead parts.

96
00:04:24.508 --> 00:04:26.969
We had the place crammedfull of agents in T-shirts:

97
00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:28.407
"James Robinson IS Joseph!"

98
00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:29.464
(Laughter)

99
00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:33.116
He didn't have to speak, but you knowthe bit where the three kings come in?

100
00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:35.825
They come in bearing gifts,gold, frankincense and myrrh.

101
00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.007
This really happened.

102
00:04:37.057 --> 00:04:40.147
We were sitting there, and I thinkthey just went out of sequence,

103
00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:42.750
because we talked to the little boyafterward and said,

104
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.570
"You OK with that?" They said,"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"

105
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.750
They just switched.

106
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.084
The three boys came in, four-year-oldswith tea towels on their heads.

107
00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:53.430
They put these boxes down, and the firstboy said, "I bring you gold."

108
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.728
And the second boy said,"I bring you myrrh."

109
00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:58.778
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."

110
00:04:57.884 --> 00:05:00.884
(Laughter)

111
00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:13.675
What these things have in commonis that kids will take a chance.

112
00:05:13.725 --> 00:05:17.181
If they don't know, they'll have a go.

113
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:20.774
Am I right? They're notfrightened of being wrong.

114
00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:24.736
I don't mean to say that being wrongis the same thing as being creative.

115
00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:27.850
What we do know is,if you're not prepared to be wrong,

116
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.241
you'll never come upwith anything original --

117
00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:32.845
if you're not prepared to be wrong.

118
00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:37.312
And by the time they get to be adults,most kids have lost that capacity.

119
00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:39.800
They have becomefrightened of being wrong.

120
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.514
And we run our companies like this.

121
00:05:41.564 --> 00:05:43.190
We stigmatize mistakes.

122
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.516
And we're now runningnational education systems

123
00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:48.650
where mistakes are the worstthing you can make.

124
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.782
And the result is thatwe are educating people

125
00:05:51.832 --> 00:05:54.832
out of their creative capacities.

126
00:05:54.198 --> 00:05:58.599
Picasso once said this, he saidthat all children are born artists.

127
00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.845
The problem is to remainan artist as we grow up.

128
00:06:01.895 --> 00:06:05.101
I believe this passionately,that we don't grow into creativity,

129
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:06.830
we grow out of it.

130
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.457
Or rather, we get educated out of it.

131
00:06:09.507 --> 00:06:12.507
So why is this?

132
00:06:12.024 --> 00:06:14.781
I lived in Stratford-on-Avonuntil about five years ago.

133
00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:17.762
In fact, we moved from Stratfordto Los Angeles.

134
00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:20.812
So you can imaginewhat a seamless transition this was.

135
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.460
(Laughter)

136
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.250
Actually, we lived in a placecalled Snitterfield,

137
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.525
just outside Stratford,

138
00:06:25.575 --> 00:06:28.184
which is whereShakespeare's father was born.

139
00:06:28.234 --> 00:06:30.331
Are you struck by a new thought? I was.

140
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:32.950
You don't think of Shakespearehaving a father, do you?

141
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.347
Do you?

142
00:06:34.397 --> 00:06:37.262
Because you don't thinkof Shakespeare being a child, do you?

143
00:06:37.312 --> 00:06:38.550
Shakespeare being seven?

144
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.750
I never thought of it.

145
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.466
I mean, he was seven at some point.

146
00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:44.516
He was in somebody'sEnglish class, wasn't he?

147
00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:46.806
(Laughter)

148
00:06:50.617 --> 00:06:53.617
How annoying would that be?

149
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.970
(Laughter)

150
00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.839
"Must try harder."

151
00:07:01.203 --> 00:07:04.203
(Laughter)

152
00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:08.414
Being sent to bed by his dad,to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!"

153
00:07:08.464 --> 00:07:09.596
To William Shakespeare.

154
00:07:09.646 --> 00:07:12.646
"And put the pencil down!"

155
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:13.941
(Laughter)

156
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.040
"And stop speaking like that."

157
00:07:13.541 --> 00:07:16.541
(Laughter)

158
00:07:17.144 --> 00:07:20.144
"It's confusing everybody."

159
00:07:18.492 --> 00:07:21.492
(Laughter)

160
00:07:23.786 --> 00:07:28.946
Anyway, we movedfrom Stratford to Los Angeles,

161
00:07:28.996 --> 00:07:31.446
and I just want to say a wordabout the transition.

162
00:07:31.496 --> 00:07:33.272
Actually, my son didn't want to come.

163
00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:35.691
I've got two kids;he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.

164
00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:37.918
He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.

165
00:07:37.968 --> 00:07:41.730
He loved it, but he hada girlfriend in England.

166
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.611
This was the love of his life, Sarah.

167
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:47.661
He'd known her for a month.

168
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.060
(Laughter)

169
00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:50.687
Mind you, they'd hadtheir fourth anniversary,

170
00:07:50.737 --> 00:07:52.647
because it's a long time when you're 16.

171
00:07:52.697 --> 00:07:54.312
He was really upset on the plane.

172
00:07:54.362 --> 00:07:56.743
He said, "I'll never findanother girl like Sarah."

173
00:07:56.793 --> 00:07:59.793
And we were rather pleasedabout that, frankly --

174
00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:02.131
(Laughter)

175
00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:10.334
because she was the main reasonwe were leaving the country.

176
00:08:10.304 --> 00:08:13.304
(Laughter)

177
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:18.377
But something strikes youwhen you move to America

178
00:08:18.427 --> 00:08:19.768
and travel around the world:

179
00:08:19.818 --> 00:08:23.439
every education system on earthhas the same hierarchy of subjects.

180
00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:25.366
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.

181
00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:27.660
You'd think it would beotherwise, but it isn't.

182
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.665
At the top are mathematics and languages,then the humanities.

183
00:08:30.715 --> 00:08:32.980
At the bottom are the arts.Everywhere on earth.

184
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:37.369
And in pretty much every system, too,there's a hierarchy within the arts.

185
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.250
Art and music are normally givena higher status in schools

186
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.702
than drama and dance.

187
00:08:41.752 --> 00:08:43.833
There isn't an educationsystem on the planet

188
00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:45.776
that teaches dance every day to children

189
00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:47.450
the way we teach them mathematics.

190
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.632
Why?

191
00:08:48.682 --> 00:08:49.823
Why not?

192
00:08:49.873 --> 00:08:51.441
I think this is rather important.

193
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:53.729
I think math is very important,but so is dance.

194
00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:56.633
Children dance all the timeif they're allowed to, we all do.

195
00:08:56.683 --> 00:08:59.683
We all have bodies, don't we?Did I miss a meeting?

196
00:08:59.157 --> 00:09:02.157
(Laughter)

197
00:09:02.545 --> 00:09:04.840
Truthfully, what happens is,as children grow up,

198
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.578
we start to educate them progressivelyfrom the waist up.

199
00:09:07.628 --> 00:09:09.228
And then we focus on their heads.

200
00:09:09.278 --> 00:09:12.278
And slightly to one side.

201
00:09:11.944 --> 00:09:13.989
If you were to visit education as an alien

202
00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:16.994
and say "What's it for, public education?"

203
00:09:17.044 --> 00:09:19.745
I think you'd have to conclude,if you look at the output,

204
00:09:19.795 --> 00:09:21.126
who really succeeds by this,

205
00:09:21.176 --> 00:09:22.850
who does everything they should,

206
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.605
who gets all the brownie points,who are the winners --

207
00:09:25.655 --> 00:09:28.867
I think you'd have to concludethe whole purpose of public education

208
00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:30.089
throughout the world

209
00:09:30.139 --> 00:09:32.568
is to produce university professors.

210
00:09:32.618 --> 00:09:33.760
Isn't it?

211
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.768
They're the people who come out the top.

212
00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:38.818
And I used to be one, so there.

213
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:40.661
(Laughter)

214
00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:42.956
And I like university professors,

215
00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:44.895
but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up

216
00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:47.850
as the high-water markof all human achievement.

217
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.987
They're just a form of life.

218
00:09:50.037 --> 00:09:51.434
Another form of life.

219
00:09:51.484 --> 00:09:52.855
But they're rather curious.

220
00:09:52.905 --> 00:09:54.843
And I say this out of affection for them:

221
00:09:54.893 --> 00:09:56.942
there's something curiousabout professors.

222
00:09:56.992 --> 00:10:00.712
In my experience -- not all of them,but typically -- they live in their heads.

223
00:10:00.762 --> 00:10:03.345
They live up thereand slightly to one side.

224
00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:06.805
They're disembodied, you know,in a kind of literal way.

225
00:10:06.855 --> 00:10:09.855
They look upon their body as a formof transport for their heads.

226
00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:13.029
(Laughter)

227
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.451
Don't they?

228
00:10:17.501 --> 00:10:20.501
It's a way of gettingtheir head to meetings.

229
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.670
(Laughter)

230
00:10:24.922 --> 00:10:28.818
If you want real evidenceof out-of-body experiences, by the way,

231
00:10:28.868 --> 00:10:32.317
get yourself along to a residentialconference of senior academics

232
00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:35.367
and pop into the discothequeon the final night.

233
00:10:34.742 --> 00:10:37.742
(Laughter)

234
00:10:37.378 --> 00:10:38.708
And there, you will see it.

235
00:10:38.758 --> 00:10:41.758
Grown men and womenwrithing uncontrollably, off the beat.

236
00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:46.275
(Laughter)

237
00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:48.791
Waiting until it ends, so they cango home and write a paper about it.

238
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.140
(Laughter)

239
00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:54.980
Our education system is predicatedon the idea of academic ability.

240
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.175
And there's a reason.

241
00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:59.828
Around the world, there wereno public systems of education,

242
00:10:59.878 --> 00:11:01.959
really, before the 19th century.

243
00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:05.230
They all came into beingto meet the needs of industrialism.

244
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.280
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.

245
00:11:07.356 --> 00:11:11.892
Number one, that the most usefulsubjects for work are at the top.

246
00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:14.949
So you were probably steered benignly awayfrom things at school

247
00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:16.125
when you were a kid,

248
00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:17.302
things you liked,

249
00:11:17.352 --> 00:11:19.768
on the grounds you would neverget a job doing that.

250
00:11:19.818 --> 00:11:20.943
Is that right?

251
00:11:20.993 --> 00:11:23.379
"Don't do music, you're notgoing to be a musician;

252
00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:25.254
don't do art, you won't be an artist."

253
00:11:25.304 --> 00:11:28.024
Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.

254
00:11:28.074 --> 00:11:31.074
The whole worldis engulfed in a revolution.

255
00:11:30.243 --> 00:11:32.314
And the second is academic ability,

256
00:11:32.364 --> 00:11:35.157
which has really come to dominateour view of intelligence,

257
00:11:35.207 --> 00:11:37.920
because the universities designthe system in their image.

258
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.095
If you think of it,

259
00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:42.783
the whole system of public educationaround the world is a protracted process

260
00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:43.958
of university entrance.

261
00:11:44.008 --> 00:11:46.275
And the consequence isthat many highly talented,

262
00:11:46.325 --> 00:11:48.817
brilliant, creative peoplethink they're not,

263
00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:50.974
because the thingthey were good at at school

264
00:11:51.024 --> 00:11:53.300
wasn't valued,or was actually stigmatized.

265
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.350
And I think we can't affordto go on that way.

266
00:11:55.603 --> 00:11:57.864
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,

267
00:11:57.914 --> 00:12:01.294
more people worldwide will begraduating through education

268
00:12:01.344 --> 00:12:03.513
than since the beginning of history.

269
00:12:03.563 --> 00:12:04.694
More people.

270
00:12:04.744 --> 00:12:07.639
And it's the combinationof all the things we've talked about:

271
00:12:07.689 --> 00:12:10.056
technology and itstransformational effect on work,

272
00:12:10.106 --> 00:12:13.106
and demography and the hugeexplosion in population.

273
00:12:12.608 --> 00:12:15.019
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.

274
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:16.720
Isn't that true?

275
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.725
When I was a student,if you had a degree, you had a job.

276
00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:22.547
If you didn't have a job,it's because you didn't want one.

277
00:12:22.597 --> 00:12:25.597
And I didn't want one, frankly.

278
00:12:24.955 --> 00:12:27.955
(Laughter)

279
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:30.349
But now kids with degreesare often heading home

280
00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.167
to carry on playing video games,

281
00:12:32.217 --> 00:12:35.239
because you need an MAwhere the previous job required a BA,

282
00:12:35.289 --> 00:12:37.050
and now you need a PhD for the other.

283
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.850
It's a process of academic inflation.

284
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.630
And it indicates the whole structureof education is shifting beneath our feet.

285
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.680
We need to radically rethinkour view of intelligence.

286
00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:47.144
We know three things about intelligence.

287
00:12:47.194 --> 00:12:48.319
One, it's diverse.

288
00:12:48.369 --> 00:12:51.324
We think about the world in all the waysthat we experience it.

289
00:12:51.374 --> 00:12:54.325
We think visually, we think in sound,we think kinesthetically.

290
00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:56.670
We think in abstract terms,we think in movement.

291
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.523
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.

292
00:12:59.573 --> 00:13:01.850
If you look at the interactionsof a human brain,

293
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.897
as we heard yesterdayfrom a number of presentations,

294
00:13:04.947 --> 00:13:07.079
intelligence is wonderfully interactive.

295
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:09.722
The brain isn't divided into compartments.

296
00:13:09.772 --> 00:13:11.320
In fact, creativity --

297
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.364
which I define as the process of havingoriginal ideas that have value --

298
00:13:15.414 --> 00:13:17.318
more often than not comes about

299
00:13:17.368 --> 00:13:20.368
through the interaction of differentdisciplinary ways of seeing things.

300
00:13:22.372 --> 00:13:25.977
By the way, there's a shaft of nervesthat joins the two halves of the brain,

301
00:13:26.027 --> 00:13:27.299
called the corpus callosum.

302
00:13:27.349 --> 00:13:29.321
It's thicker in women.

303
00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:31.068
Following off from Helen yesterday,

304
00:13:31.118 --> 00:13:34.103
this is probably why womenare better at multitasking.

305
00:13:34.153 --> 00:13:35.952
Because you are, aren't you?

306
00:13:36.002 --> 00:13:39.715
There's a raft of research,but I know it from my personal life.

307
00:13:39.765 --> 00:13:44.074
If my wife is cooking a mealat home, which is not often ...

308
00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:47.124
thankfully.

309
00:13:45.314 --> 00:13:48.314
(Laughter)

310
00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:49.454
No, she's good at some things.

311
00:13:49.504 --> 00:13:52.373
But if she's cooking,she's dealing with people on the phone,

312
00:13:52.423 --> 00:13:55.423
she's talking to the kids,she's painting the ceiling --

313
00:13:55.094 --> 00:13:58.094
(Laughter)

314
00:13:56.133 --> 00:13:58.132
she's doing open-heart surgery over here.

315
00:13:58.182 --> 00:14:01.154
If I'm cooking, the dooris shut, the kids are out,

316
00:14:01.204 --> 00:14:02.417
the phone's on the hook,

317
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.131
if she comes in, I get annoyed.

318
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:07.181
I say, "Terry, please,I'm trying to fry an egg in here."

319
00:14:06.995 --> 00:14:09.995
(Laughter)

320
00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:17.154
"Give me a break."

321
00:14:15.378 --> 00:14:18.378
(Laughter)

322
00:14:17.122 --> 00:14:19.595
Actually, do you knowthat old philosophical thing,

323
00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:23.102
"If a tree falls in a forest,and nobody hears it, did it happen?"

324
00:14:23.152 --> 00:14:24.455
Remember that old chestnut?

325
00:14:24.505 --> 00:14:27.389
I saw a great T-shirtrecently, which said,

326
00:14:27.439 --> 00:14:30.850
"If a man speaks his mind in a forest,and no woman hears him,

327
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.900
is he still wrong?"

328
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.320
(Laughter)

329
00:14:39.989 --> 00:14:42.002
And the third thing about intelligence is,

330
00:14:42.052 --> 00:14:43.964
it's distinct.

331
00:14:44.014 --> 00:14:46.492
I'm doing a new book at the momentcalled "Epiphany,"

332
00:14:46.542 --> 00:14:48.957
which is based on a seriesof interviews with people

333
00:14:49.007 --> 00:14:50.845
about how they discovered their talent.

334
00:14:50.895 --> 00:14:52.990
I'm fascinated byhow people got to be there.

335
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.205
It's really prompted by a conversationI had with a wonderful woman

336
00:14:56.255 --> 00:14:58.906
who maybe most peoplehave never heard of, Gillian Lynne.

337
00:14:58.956 --> 00:15:00.526
Have you heard of her? Some have.

338
00:15:00.576 --> 00:15:03.002
She's a choreographer,and everybody knows her work.

339
00:15:03.052 --> 00:15:05.042
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."

340
00:15:05.092 --> 00:15:06.217
She's wonderful.

341
00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:09.267
I used to be on the boardof The Royal Ballet, as you can see.

342
00:15:09.238 --> 00:15:12.238
(Laughter)

343
00:15:11.191 --> 00:15:14.690
Gillian and I had lunch one day.I said, "How did you get to be a dancer?"

344
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.865
It was interesting.

345
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.136
When she was at school,she was really hopeless.

346
00:15:18.186 --> 00:15:20.949
And the school, in the '30s,wrote to her parents and said,

347
00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:23.008
"We think Gillianhas a learning disorder."

348
00:15:23.058 --> 00:15:25.130
She couldn't concentrate;she was fidgeting.

349
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.031
I think now they'd say she had ADHD.

350
00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:28.354
Wouldn't you?

351
00:15:28.404 --> 00:15:32.555
But this was the 1930s, and ADHDhadn't been invented at this point.

352
00:15:32.605 --> 00:15:35.605
It wasn't an available condition.

353
00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:37.669
(Laughter)

354
00:15:37.908 --> 00:15:40.908
People weren't aware they could have that.

355
00:15:39.974 --> 00:15:42.974
(Laughter)

356
00:15:42.423 --> 00:15:46.573
Anyway, she went to see this specialist.

357
00:15:46.623 --> 00:15:50.304
So, this oak-paneled room,and she was there with her mother,

358
00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:52.655
and she was led and saton this chair at the end,

359
00:15:52.705 --> 00:15:54.624
and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes,

360
00:15:54.674 --> 00:15:56.329
while this man talked to her mother

361
00:15:56.379 --> 00:15:58.817
about all the problemsGillian was having at school,

362
00:15:58.867 --> 00:16:02.390
because she was disturbing people,her homework was always late, and so on.

363
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.565
Little kid of eight.

364
00:16:03.615 --> 00:16:06.500
In the end, the doctor wentand sat next to Gillian and said,

365
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.237
"I've listened to all thesethings your mother's told me.

366
00:16:09.287 --> 00:16:10.855
I need to speak to her privately.

367
00:16:10.905 --> 00:16:13.195
Wait here. We'll be back.We won't be very long,"

368
00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:16.245
and they went and left her.

369
00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:17.533
But as they went out of the room,

370
00:16:17.583 --> 00:16:20.413
he turned on the radiothat was sitting on his desk.

371
00:16:20.463 --> 00:16:22.075
And when they got out of the room,

372
00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:24.477
he said to her mother,"Just stand and watch her."

373
00:16:24.527 --> 00:16:27.013
And the minute they left the room,

374
00:16:27.063 --> 00:16:29.632
she was on her feet, moving to the music.

375
00:16:29.682 --> 00:16:33.159
And they watched for a few minutes,and he turned to her mother and said,

376
00:16:33.209 --> 00:16:35.162
"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick.

377
00:16:35.212 --> 00:16:38.188
She's a dancer.

378
00:16:38.238 --> 00:16:41.238
Take her to a dance school."

379
00:16:39.648 --> 00:16:40.850
I said, "What happened?"

380
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.850
She said, "She did. I can't tell youhow wonderful it was.

381
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.703
We walked in this room,and it was full of people like me --

382
00:16:46.753 --> 00:16:48.949
people who couldn't sit still,

383
00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:51.880
people who had to move to think."

384
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.736
Who had to move to think.

385
00:16:53.786 --> 00:16:57.370
They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;they did modern; they did contemporary.

386
00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.140
She was eventually auditionedfor the Royal Ballet School.

387
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.417
She became a soloist; she hada wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.

388
00:17:03.467 --> 00:17:05.996
She eventually graduatedfrom the Royal Ballet School,

389
00:17:06.046 --> 00:17:07.948
founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,

390
00:17:07.998 --> 00:17:09.209
met Andrew Lloyd Webber.

391
00:17:09.259 --> 00:17:10.529
She's been responsible for

392
00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:13.701
some of the most successfulmusical theater productions in history,

393
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:15.321
she's given pleasure to millions,

394
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:16.752
and she's a multimillionaire.

395
00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:19.802
Somebody else might have put heron medication and told her to calm down.

396
00:17:20.536 --> 00:17:23.536
(Applause)

397
00:17:28.503 --> 00:17:30.050
What I think it comes to is this:

398
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.850
Al Gore spoke the other night

399
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:37.107
about ecology and the revolutionthat was triggered by Rachel Carson.

400
00:17:37.157 --> 00:17:39.243
I believe our only hope for the future

401
00:17:39.293 --> 00:17:43.142
is to adopt a new conceptionof human ecology,

402
00:17:43.192 --> 00:17:45.693
one in which we startto reconstitute our conception

403
00:17:45.743 --> 00:17:47.978
of the richness of human capacity.

404
00:17:48.028 --> 00:17:51.373
Our education system has mined our minds

405
00:17:51.423 --> 00:17:55.227
in the way that we strip-mine the earthfor a particular commodity.

406
00:17:55.277 --> 00:17:57.673
And for the future, it won't serve us.

407
00:17:57.723 --> 00:17:59.850
We have to rethinkthe fundamental principles

408
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.900
on which we're educating our children.

409
00:18:01.987 --> 00:18:04.635
There was a wonderful quoteby Jonas Salk, who said,

410
00:18:04.685 --> 00:18:09.756
"If all the insectswere to disappear from the Earth,

411
00:18:09.806 --> 00:18:13.620
within 50 years,all life on Earth would end.

412
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.681
If all human beingsdisappeared from the Earth,

413
00:18:16.731 --> 00:18:20.228
within 50 years,all forms of life would flourish."

414
00:18:20.278 --> 00:18:23.278
And he's right.

415
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.383
What TED celebrates is the giftof the human imagination.

416
00:18:26.433 --> 00:18:30.641
We have to be careful nowthat we use this gift wisely,

417
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:33.894
and that we avert some of the scenariosthat we've talked about.

418
00:18:33.944 --> 00:18:37.673
And the only way we'll do itis by seeing our creative capacities

419
00:18:37.723 --> 00:18:39.484
for the richness they are

420
00:18:39.534 --> 00:18:42.690
and seeing our childrenfor the hope that they are.

421
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.112
And our task is to educatetheir whole being,

422
00:18:45.162 --> 00:18:46.549
so they can face this future.

423
00:18:46.599 --> 00:18:49.078
By the way -- we may not see this future,

424
00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.665
but they will.

425
00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:53.715
And our job is to help themmake something of it.

426
00:18:53.457 --> 00:18:56.457
Thank you very much.

427
00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:57.666
(Applause)
